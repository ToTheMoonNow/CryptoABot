A fork from Gekko. The MD4ECryptoBot contains over 20 different indicators and strategies for crypto trading using a number of different trend patterns to identify buy- and sell signals in the crypto market.

It contains paper-trading (simulates real trades against an exchange) functionality and contains extensive configuration options to enable buy-/sell-protection and can be customised as all code will be accessible and is easy to change (it is Javascript after all).

## Sign up to Crypto Exchanges now
Most exchanges are getting full and [Bitfinix](https://www.bitfinex.com) halted signups in December 2017. I suggest that you get accounts setup as soon as possible and get yourself verified.

Ensure that you sign up with [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=16991383) for #altcointrading and get your trading account going. 

## Get a Ledger Nano S
Read my [review of the Ledger Nano S](https://www.naschenweng.info/2017/12/07/ledger-s-crypto-currency-hardware-wallet/) on my blog. It is worthwhile to have a hardware wallet.


## Get started
TBD - tested code will release by 31st January. For the last 2 weeks I have been trading on [Bitfinix](https://www.bitfinex.com) with Ripple, IOTA, DATA. I moved $300 in IOTA trades to $600. Ripple moved from $300 to $1000.

In the image below you can see a "long" executing on a USD/DATA trade:

Since I am happy with how Bitfenix trading works, I have now moved to [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=16991383) to test XVG (Verge) and TRX (Tron).

## Installation
The long-term idea is to run multiple bots via Docker or via the command line.

I have received some generous donations with a request to share the code-base right now. I am glad to do this but will not provide any support. I might change this repo into private going forward if I receive more requests and then share updates until the public release.

If you want access to the code-base, please send me a message with your transaction ID/sender address for any of the currencies above. I will only send you the code-base via PGP. You can find my key on my Twitter account https://twitter.com/gerdnaschenweng
